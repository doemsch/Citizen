# Let's get started here!

# the overall goal is to create a quiz that asks me 20 randomly selected questions that are stored in a .csv file
# the answers are multiple choice (4) and there shall be one correct answer and three incorrect answers
# when I answer a question using the letters A-D, I shall get "Great job!" if correct or "More luck next time!" if incorrect
# after the twenty questions the score shall be displayed as a percentage
# I shall be able to exit out of the quiz by typing "X"
